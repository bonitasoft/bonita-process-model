= ResourceName REST API
REST API to manage resourceName

The project **resourceNameRestAPI** is a Bonita REST API extension for **Bonita {short-bonita-version}** version  **community** written in `java` language.

_**TODO**_: A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

== Features

_**TODO**_: What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?

* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

== Getting started

_**TODO**_: A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.
For more details on Bonita REST API extension please refer to {doc-url}/rest-api-extension-archetype[documentation]

== Developing
_**TODO**_: Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Prerequisite:

- a git client
- a java ( **jdk {java-version}** or higher)
- maven (optional if you choosed to use https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper script] as archetype option)

=== Building

_**TODO**_: If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://your.github.com/resourceNameRestAPI.git
cd resourceNameRestAPI/
mvn package
----

The build should produce a zip archive under the `target/` folder named `resourceNameRestAPI-0.0.1.zip`

_**TODO**_: Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

For more details about apache maven, please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[documentation]

=== Deploying / Publishing

_**TODO**_: In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, this is the right time to state it.

Take the built artifact `resourceNameRestAPI-0.0.1.zip` and upload it to your Bonita platform (see {doc-url}/rest-api-extension-archetype#_deployment[rest-api-extension deployment])

== Configuration

_**TODO**_: Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

=== page.properties

[source, properties]
----
include::src/main/resources/page.properties[]
----

=== configuration.properties

[source, properties]
----
include::src/main/resources/configuration.properties[]
----

== Contributing

_**TODO**_: Make easy to your team to jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.adoc` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

== Links

_**TODO**_: Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

. Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
. Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
. Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
.. In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
